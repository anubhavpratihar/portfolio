                  <strong>Internship at Cyraacs Bangalore.</strong>
                </h6>
                <p>
                As an intern in the GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) department at Cyraacs Bangalore,
                 I had several key responsibilities. I assisted in conducting risk assessments and audits to identify
                  potential vulnerabilities and compliance gaps. Collaborating with the team, I contributed to the 
                  development and implementation of policies and procedures to ensure regulatory compliance. 
                  I participated in evaluating internal controls, suggesting improvements, and supporting the maintenance
                   of risk management frameworks. Additionally, I assisted in creating and delivering training programs on 
                   compliance and risk management for employees. I conducted research on industry regulations, 
                   staying updated on compliance requirements. I prepared reports for regulatory agencies 
                   and internal stakeholders, while also assisting in monitoring and assessing compliance with laws,
                    regulations, and company policies. My role involved working with cross-functional teams to address 
                    compliance issues and implement remediation plans, contributing to the organization's overall risk 
                    management and compliance efforts.
